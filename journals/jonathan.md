##A list of features/issues that you worked on and who you worked with, if applicable

Reviewed API Endpoints and Wireframe design with Rosheen as a group.

##A reflection on any design conversations that you had

I am still fuzzy on how all the different systems we have been learning all fit together for
the project and we have had discussions on what tables we will need, what information the
requests will take from what and how we might go about doing that with PostgreSQL in a kind
of verbal pseudocode.

##At least one ah-ha! moment that you had during your coding, however small

Getting the pgAdmin tool connected to the project was causing me problems and had to look at
multiple tutorials on getting the exact keywords needed to get a server running. Getting it
running was a ah-ha! moment.
