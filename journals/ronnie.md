## February 19, 2024 - February 26, 2024

This will be a journal for the first from the 19th - 26th

This week, I worked on:

* Created, cloned, and tested docker for the project

Jonathan forked the project and did all of the necessary steps in
order to allow everyone access. Cloned the project and pruned and
composed the docker.

Created Ronnie.md in journals to start my journal.

We finished our framework and defined out endpoints and are now waiting
for them to be checked.

## reflection on design
After getting feedback on our project, we are realizing how far our project
can deviate from our original design. If we decide we don't want a particular
feature we also have to look through our project to remove sections that are tied
to the feature that we are removing. If not, dead code will be left in.

## ah-ha! moment
We found out that we don't have to create a new project to change the name
of the project. There is a place to change the pathways which avoids having
to restart everything.
